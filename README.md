# üöÄ Automated Report Card Generation Using Multi-Source Integration & AI 

## üîç Project Overview
Led an AI-powered CRM automation project to eliminate manual report card creation for Account Coordinators by integrating data from Dynamics 365 CRM, TSEE, Review platforms, and a GPT-based internal AI tool. Automated 15 scoring fields per report card, reducing 40+ minutes of manual effort and scaling standardized scoring across 19,000+ agents.

## üß† Business Problem
Account Coordinators were manually aggregating data from multiple sources to produce agent performance report cards‚Äîa process that was time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent in scoring methodology. The need was for a scalable, automated reporting system that ensured data accuracy, consistency, and operational efficiency.

## ‚úÖ AI-Driven Solution Highlights
- Designed AI logic to extract and analyze real-time content from agent websites (e.g., About Me, Mission Statement) using a GPT-based tool.
- Co-developed validation and business rules for auto-populating 15 scoring fields with CRM, TSEE, and AI-derived data.
- Implemented a hybrid model distinguishing AI vs. non-AI field handling.
- Built workflows for near-real-time syncing, review, and delivery of report cards

## üíº Business Analyst & AI Consultant Responsibilities
- Collaborated closely with AI engineers to define and refine AI scoring logic aligned with business goals.
- Led requirements elicitation, process mapping (As-Is/To-Be), and user story creation focused on AI automation and integration workflows.
- Defined acceptance criteria for AI and non-AI driven fields and coordinated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to validate AI outputs.
- Managed cross-functional communication between stakeholders, AI developers, and operational teams to ensure smooth deployment and adoption.
- Provided ongoing post-launch support, including analysis and resolution of scoring discrepancies via ticketing systems.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM
- Internal GPT-based AI Tool for content extraction and scoring
