# 🚀 Automated Report Card Generation Using Multi-Source Integration & AI 

## 🔍 Project Overview
Led an AI-powered CRM automation project to eliminate manual report card creation for Account Coordinators by integrating data from Dynamics 365 CRM, TSEE, Review platforms, and an internal AI tool. Automated 15 scoring fields, reducing manual effort by 40+ minutes per report and significantly enhancing reporting accuracy, speed, and scalability.

Account Coordinators were manually aggregating data from multiple sources to produce agent performance report cards—a process that was time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent in scoring methodology. The need was for a scalable, automated reporting system that ensured data accuracy, consistency, and operational efficiency.
